# Visual Flow Diagram Analysis

## Diagram 1: Basic Payment Flow (8 Steps)
**Components:** Client, Server, Facilitator

### Flow Sequence:
1. **GET /api** - Client initiates API request to Server
2. **402 - Payment required** - Server responds with payment requirement
3. **Select payment method and create payload** - Client-side payment preparation
4. **Include Header: X-PAYMENT: b64 payload** - Client sends payment header to Server
5. **/verify** - Server forwards verification request to Facilitator
6. **Verification** - Facilitator returns verification response to Server
7. **do work to fulfill request** - Server processes the original request
8. **/settle** - Server initiates settlement process with Facilitator

## Diagram 2: Extended Blockchain Flow (12 Steps)
**Components:** Client, Server, Facilitator, Blockchain

### Flow Sequence:
1. **GET /api** - Client initiates API request to Server
2. **402 - Payment required** - Server responds with payment requirement
3. **Select payment method and create payload** - Client-side payment preparation
4. **Include Header: X-PAYMENT: b64 payload** - Client sends payment header to Server
5. **/verify** - Server forwards verification request to Facilitator
6. **Verification** - Facilitator returns verification response to Server
7. **do work to fulfill request** - Server processes the original request
8. **/settle** - Server initiates settlement process with Facilitator
9. **Subit tx w/ sig to usdc contract** - Facilitator submits transaction to Blockchain
10. **Tx confirmed** - Blockchain confirms transaction back to Facilitator
11. **Settled** - Facilitator confirms settlement to Server
12. **return response w/ X-PAYMENT RESPONSE** - Server returns final response with payment confirmation to Client

## Key Observations:

### Payment Protocol Structure:
- Uses HTTP 402 status code for payment requirements
- Implements X-PAYMENT header for payment data transmission
- Base64 encoded payload for payment information
- Verification step before request fulfillment

### Architecture Evolution:
- Basic flow handles verification and settlement through facilitator
- Extended flow adds blockchain integration for permanent settlement
- USDC contract integration suggests stablecoin payment support
- Transaction confirmation provides cryptographic proof of payment

### Integration Points:
- Client handles payment method selection and payload creation
- Server manages request/response cycle and payment verification
- Facilitator acts as payment processor and blockchain interface
- Blockchain provides final settlement and transaction immutability

### Security Features:
- Multi-step verification process
- Cryptographic signatures for blockchain transactions
- Separate verification and settlement phases
- Payment response headers for confirmation
